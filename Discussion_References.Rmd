## Applications
These profit profiles are intended to support the management of commercial fisheries in the Northeast U.S. The results presented have a number of different applications, including:

1. Allowing end-users to gain a better understanding of cost distributions by fishing fleet. In economic analyses to support management, operating profit/net revenue is      most often calculated. Across FMPs, operating costs account for varying levels of total costs.
2. Allowing end-users to gain a better understanding of how gross revenues translate to profit by fishing fleet.  
3. Supporting research into the viability of fishing operations. By examining the economic health of commercial vessels, the implications of management actions on fisheries  can be better understood. These potential actions include, but are not limited to:
    a. Changes in fishing quotas/days-at-sea 
    b. Re-allocation of quota among sectors (e.g. commercial vs. recreational)
    c. Establishment or modification of accumulation limits
    d. Changes in costs faced by fishing vessels (e.g. monitoring) 

For management purposes, these profiles can be incorporated into the Affected Environment: Human Communities section for various FMP actions. This section has frequently focused on trends in gross revenue and fishery effort. Profit provides additional information in capturing the current state of the fishery. When looking at operating profit, mean and median values are relatively close for a number of gear types (scallop dredge, longline, pot trap) and fisheries (herring, lobster, scallop). The disparity between mean and median tends to increase when looking at total profit as more sporadic costs are incorporated. In other words, it is difficult to assess what a “typical vessel” in a particular gear group or fishery looks given large distributions. 

The profiles can also be incorporated into the economic impact analysis of management actions. For example, the ratio of total profits to gross revenues can inform how changes in quota impact the bottom line of vessel operators. For the squid, mackerel, butterfish fishery, the ratio of total profit/gross revenue is 33% when using mean values and 26% using median values. For the scallop fishery, these numbers are 32% and 17% respectively. For the groundfish fishery, these numbers are 26% and 8%.

## Limitations and Future Work
The use of these profit profiles does have some limitations. The Commercial Fishing Business Cost Survey is conducted within the Northeast region every few years. For some vessel owners, 2022 may have been an unusually profitable year, either through increased revenues, decreased costs, or a combination. In contrast, other vessels likely experienced a less profitable year than normal in 2022. A vessel owner may have been more/less likely to respond based on their economic situation during 2022. Since the cost survey is not conducted on an annual basis, and the individuals that respond to the survey vary, it is difficult to assess this effect.  

As more years of data are available, the better we can understand the economic performance of fishing fleets in the region. Data collected in future surveys will feed into the profit calculations presented on this site. Similar to the gear/FMP dropdown function, the user will be able to query the year of interest.
