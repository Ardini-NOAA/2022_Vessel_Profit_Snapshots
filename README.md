This repo contains the site "The Use of Cost Survey Data to Calculate Vessel Profits for Commercial Fishing Fleets in the Northeast U.s." 
Currently the site focuses on calendar year 2022- the most recent year for cost information is available within the region. 
The following folders are available:

scripts_datasets_to_generate_input_files: SAS scripts are listed in sequential order

input_files: csv files produced from the final SAS script, "combine"

Once the csv files are produced, the index.Rmd file generates the site.
