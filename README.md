This repo contains the site "The Use of Cost Survey Data to Calculate Vessel Profits for Commercial Fishing Fleets in the Northeast U.S." 
The site first provides background on the Greater Atlantic Region Commercial Fishing Business Cost Survey, fielded by the Social Sciences Branch of the 
Northeast Fisheries Science Center. Next, the metrics on the site are discussed along with the protocol for filtering survey responses for use on the site.
Methods for calculating profit are then discussed, followed by fleet revenue and cost summaries. Operating and total profit are presented by 
both primary gear and fishery. The site focuses on calendar year 2022- the most recent year for which cost information is available within the region.

The full code to generate the site is available in the index.Rmd file. For smaller segments of code, see the intro_methods_1, revenue_cost_2, 
profit_3, and discussion_4 Rmds.

The following folders are available:

scripts_datasets_to_generate_input_files: SAS scripts are listed in sequential order

input_files: csv files produced from the final SAS script, "combine"

docs: figures for the site are contained within the SSB_Profit_Profiles_files/figure-html sub-folder.

references: Includes links to all papers referenced in the site.
